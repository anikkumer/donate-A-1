            <h1>Our Donation Plan</h1>
            <p>Some approaches to supporting a charity can move the needle more than others. For example, the
                  simple act
                  of supporting necessary—but unglamorous and underfunded—needs can make those dollars go further
                  and
                  accomplish more. And when you couple your donation with a commitment to volunteer or advocate
                  for the
                  charity or cause, you create added leverage.</p>
